# QPic
A chrome extension about uploading pictures to cloud platform
### Where the idea come from
Recently, our course project need to manage a large number of pictures and we decide to use Qiniu cloud to help us manage the pictures. Taking this opportunity, I've learnt how to upload and storage pictures to Qiniu cloud in JavaScript client. By the way, it occurs to me that why not to make a tool to help me upload the pictures? So, I decide to create a chrome extension to help uploading pictures more easily. What's more, I also want to create a tool that can help me solve the problem about storaging the pictures in Markdown writing. If it comes true, I will not storage the pictures at github that are using in Markdown, and I will upload it to Qiniu cloud and use the pictures' URL.
